    (b) Order of Application of Partial Payments and Periodic Payments. Except as otherwise described in this  Section 2, if Lender applies a payment, such payment will be applied to each Periodic Payment in the order in which it  became due, beginning with the oldest outstanding Periodic Payment, as follows: first to interest and then to principal  due under the Note, and finally to Escrow Items. If all outstanding Periodic Payments then due are paid in full,   any payment amounts remaining may be applied to late charges and to any amounts then due under this Security  Instrument. If all sums then due under the Note and this Security Instrument are paid in full, any remaining payment  amount may be applied, in Lender's sole discretion, to a future Periodic Payment or to reduce the principal balance of  the Note.    If Lender receives a payment from Borrower in the amount of one or more Periodic Payments and the amount of any  late charge due for a delinquent Periodic Payment, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment and the late    charge.  When applying payments, Lender will apply such payments in accordance with Applicable Law.    (c) Voluntary Prepayments. Voluntary prepayments will be applied as described in the Note.    (d) No Change to Payment Schedule.

The  term Escrow Items is defined above in the section entitled "Words Used Often In This Document." Each Periodic  Payment will include an amount to be applied toward the payment of the Escrow Items.    The amount of the Funds required to be paid each month may change during the term of the Loan. The monthly  payment that I will make for Escrow Items will be based on Lender’s estimate of the annual amount required. | will  promptly send Lender a copy of all notices of amounts to be paid under this Section 3.    (b) Payment of Funds; Waiver. I must pay Lender the Funds unless Lender tells me, in writing, that I do not have to  do so, or unless Applicable Law requires otherwise.    [ must include the Funds as part of my regular Periodic Payments to Lender unless Lender waives this requirement  in writing. Lender may waive this payment obligation for any or all Escrow Items at any time. In the event of such  waiver, I will pay all Escrow Items covered by the waiver directly, when and where payable. I will provide proof of  my direct payments of Escrow Items upon request by Lender and within such time period as Lender may require. My  obligation to make such payments and to provide proof of payment will be considered to be a promise and agreement  of Borrower under this Security Instrument. If I am obligated to pay Escrow Items directly pursuant to a waiver, and  I fail to pay timely the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9 to pay that  amount and | will then be obligated to repay to Lender any such amount in accordance with Section 9,    Lender may withdraw the waiver as to any or all Escrow Items at any time by giving me a notice in accordance with  Section 16; upon such withdrawal, I will pay to Lender all Funds for such Escrow Items, and in such amounts, that are    then required under this Section 3.    (c) Amount of Funds. Lender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount up to, but not in excess of, the  maximum amount a lender can require under RESPA.

If Lender is such a savings or banking institution, Lender may hold the Funds. Lender will use the Funds to pay  the Escrow Items. Lender will give to me, without charge, an annual accounting of the Funds that shows all additions  to and deductions from the Funds and the reason for each deduction in the manner required by RESPA.

    Lender may not charge me for: (i) holding or keeping the Funds, or using the Funds to pay Escrow Items; (11) making  a yearly analysis of my payment of Funds; or (iii) receiving, verifying and totaling assessments and bills. However,  Lender may charge me for these services if Lender pays me interest on the Funds and if Applicable Law permits  Lender to make such a charge, Lender will not be required to pay me any interest or earnings on the Funds unless  either: (a) Lender and I agree in writing that Lender will pay interest on the Escrow Funds; or (b) Applicable Law  requires Lender to pay interest on the Funds.    (e) Adjustments to the Funds: Surplus, Shortage and Deficiency of Funds. If there is a surplus of Funds held in  escrow, Lender will refund such surplus to me to the extent required by RESPA. If my Periodic Payment is delinquent  by more than 30 days, Lender may retain the surplus in the escrow account for the payment of the Escrow Items, If  there is a shortage or deficiency of Funds held in escrow, Lender will notify me and I will pay to Lender the amount  necessary to make up the shortage or deficiency in accordance with RESPA.    When I have paid all of the Sums Secured, Lender will promptly refund to me any Funds that are then being held by  Lender.    4. Borrower’s Obligation to Pay Charges, Assessments and Claims; Liens. I will pay all taxes,  assessments, water charges, sewer rents and other similar charges, and any other charges and fines that may be  imposed on the Property and that may be or become superior to this Security Instrument. If I am a tenant under a  ground lease on the Property, I will also pay ground rents or payments due under my ground lease. I will also pay any  Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments. I will do this either by making the payments to Lender that  are described in Section 3 above or, if 1 am not required to make payments to Lender under Section 3, by making the  payments on time to the Person owed them.    I will promptly pay or satisfy all liens against the Property that may be or become superior to this Security Instrument.  However, this Security Instrument does not require me to satisfy a superior lien if: (a) I agree, in writing, to pay the  obligation which gave rise to the superior lien and Lender approves the way in which | agree to pay that obligation, but  only so long as | am performing such agreement; (b) I contest the lien in good faith by, or defend against enforcement  of the lien in, legal proceedings which Lender determines, in its sole discretion, operate to prevent the enforcement   of the lien while those proceedings are pending, but only until such proceedings are concluded; or (c) I secure from  the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender that subordinates the lien to this Security Instrument  (collectively the “Required Actions”). If Lender determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien that has  priority or may attain priority over this Security Instrument and Borrower has not taken any of the Required Actions  in regard to such lien, Lender may give me a notice identifying the lien. Within 10 days after the date on which that  notice is given, I must satisfy the lien or take one or more of the Required Actions.    5. Borrower’s Obligation to Maintain Hazard Insurance or Property Insurance.    (a) Insurance Requirements; Coverages. I will obtain hazard or property insurance to cover all buildings and other  improvements that now are, or in the future will be, located on the Property. The insurance must cover loss or damage  caused by: (i) fire; (ii) hazards normally covered by "extended coverage" hazard insurance policies; and (111) any   other hazards for which Lender requires coverage, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, winds, and floods. The  insurance must be in the amounts (including deductibles) and for the periods of time required by Lender. Lender's  requirements can change during the term of the Loan, and may exceed any minimum coverage required by Applicable  Law. I may choose the insurance carrier providing the insurance, subject to Lender's night to disapprove my choice,  which right will not be exercised unreasonably.    (b) Failure to Maintain Insurance. If Lender has a reasonable basis to believe that I have failed to maintain any   of the required insurance coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance coverage, at Lender's option and  charge me in accordance with Section 9 below. Unless required by Applicable Law, Lender is under no obligation to  advance premiums for, or to seek to reinstate, any prior lapsed coverage for insurance that I have obtained. Lender    is under no obligation to purchase any particular type or amount of coverage and may select the provider of such  insurance coverage in its sole discretion. Before purchasing such coverage, Lender will notify me if required to do so    under Applicable Law. Any such coverage will protect Lender, but might not protect me, my equity in the Property,  or the contents of the Property, against any risk, hazard, or liability and might provide greater or lesser coverage than  was previously in effect, but not exceeding the coverage required under Section 5(a), | acknowledge that the cost of  the insurance coverage so obtained may significantly exceed the cost of insurance that I could have obtained.

    amounts paid by Lender for costs associated with reinstating my insurance policy or with placing new insurance  under this Section 5 will become my Sums Secured. These amounts will bear interest at the Note rate from the date of  disbursement and will be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to me requesting payment.    (c) Insurance Policies. All insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies: (i) will be subject to  Lender's right to disapprove such policies; (ii) must include what is known as a "standard mortgage clause’ to protect  Lender; and (iii) must name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee. Lender will have the right to hold  the policies and renewal certificates. If Lender requires, I will promptly give to Lender proof of paid premiums and  renewal notices.    If I obtain any form of insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender, for damage to, or destruction of, the  Property, such policy must include a “standard mortgage clause” and must name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an    additional loss payee.    (d) Proof of Loss; Application of Proceeds. In the event of loss, I must give prompt notice to the insurance carrier  and Lender. Lender may make proof of loss if not made promptly by me. Any insurance proceeds, whether or not the  underlying insurance was required by Lender, will be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if Lender deems  the restoration or repair to be economically feasible and determines that Lender's security will not be lessened by such  restoration or repair.    If the Property is to be repaired or restored, Lender will disburse from the insurance proceeds any initial amounts that  are necessary to begin the repair or restoration, subject to any restrictions applicable to Lender.    During the subsequent repair and restoration period, Lender will have the tight to hold such insurance proceeds   until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's  satisfaction (which may include satisfying Lender’s minimum eligibility requirements for persons repairing the  Property, including, but not limited to, licensing, bond, and insurance requirements) provided that such inspection must  be undertaken promptly. Lender may disburse insurance proceeds for the repairs and restorations in a single payment  or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed, depending on the size of the repair or restoration, the  terms of the repair agreement, and whether I am in Default on the Loan. Lender may make such payments directly to  me, to the Person repairing or restoring the Property, or payable jointly to both. Lender will not be required to pay me  any interest or earnings on such insurance proceeds unless Lender and | agree in writing or Applicable Law requires  otherwise. Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties I retain, will not be paid out of the insurance proceeds and    will be my sole obligation.    If Lender deems the restoration or repair not to be economically feasible or Lender’s security would be lessened by  such restoration or repair, the insurance proceeds will be applied to the Sums Secured, whether or not then due, with  the excess, if any, paid to me. Such insurance proceeds will be applied in the order that Partial Payments are applied in    Section 2(b).    (ec) Insurance Settlenients; Assignment of Proceeds. If | abandon the Property, Lender may file, negotiate, and settle  any available insurance claim and related matters. If 1 do not answer, within 30 days, a notice from Lender stating   that the insurance company has offered to settle a claim, Lender may negotiate and settle any insurance claim, The  30-day period will begin when the notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under Section   26 or otherwise, I give Lender (i) my rights to any insurance proceeds in an amount not greater than the amounts  unpaid under the Note and this Security Instrument, and (ii) any other of my rights (other than the right to any refund  of unearned premiums that I paid) under all insurance policies covering the Property, if the rights are applicable to   the coverage of the Property. If Lender files, negotiates, or settles a claim, I agree that any insurance proceeds may   be made payable directly to Lender without the need to include me as an additional loss payee. Lender may use the  insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the Property (as provided in Section 5(d)) or to pay amounts unpaid under  the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.    6. Occupancy. I must occupy, establish, and use the Property as my principal residence within 60 days atter I sign  this Security Instrument. I will continue to occupy the Property and to use the Property as my principal residence for  at least one year. The one-year period will begin when I first occupy the Property. However, I will not have to occupy  the Property and use the Property as my principal residence within the time frames set forth above if Lender agrees   in writing that I do not have to do so. Lender may not refuse to agree unless the refusal is reasonable. I also will not         OoSsaraaoy  NEW YORK-Single Family-Fannke MaaFreccie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT (MER) Form 3003 07/2021  Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, inc.

    have to occupy the Property and use the Property as my principal residence within the time frames set forth above if  extenuating circumstances exist that are beyond my control.    7. Preservation, Maintenance, and Protection of the Property; Inspections. | will not destroy, damage,   or harm the Property, and I will not allow the Property to deteriorate or commit waste on the Property. Whether or   not | am residing in the Property, I will keep the Property in good repair so that it will not deteriorate or decrease in  value due to its condition. Unless Lender determines pursuant to Section 5 that repair or restoration is not economically  feasible, I will promptly repair the Property if damaged to avoid further deterioration or damage.    If insurance or Condemnation proceeds are paid to Lender in connection with damage to, or Condemnation of, the  Property, I will be responsible for repairing or restoring the Property only if Lender has released those insurance  proceeds for such purposes. Lender may pay for the repairs and restoration out of insurance proceeds in a single  payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed, depending on the size of the repair or  restoration, the terms of the repair agreement, and whether I am in Default on the Loan. Lender may make such  disbursements directly to me, to the Person repairing or restoring the Property, or payable jointly to both, If the  insurance or Condemnation proceeds are not sufficient to repair or restore the Property, I promise to pay for the  completion of such repair or restoration.    Lender may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the Property. If Lender has reasonable cause, Lender may  inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property. Lender will give me notice at the time of or prior to such an  interior inspection specifying such reasonable cause.    8. Borrower's Loan Application. I will be in Default if, during the Loan application process, I, or any Persons  acting at my direction or with my knowledge or consent, gave materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information  or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with material information) in connection with the Loan, including,  but not limited to, overstating my income or assets, understating or failing to provide documentation of my debt  obligations and liabilities, and misrepresenting my occupancy or intended occupancy of the Property as my principal  residence.    9. Protection of Lender’s Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument.    (a) Protection of Lender's Interest. If: (i) I do not keep my promises and agreements made in this Security  Instrument; (ii) there is a legal proceeding or government-order that may significantly aftect Lender's interest in   the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument (such as a legal proceeding in bankruptcy, in probate, for  Condemnation or Forfeiture, for enforcement of a lien that has priority or may attain priority over this Security  Instrument, or to enforce laws or regulations); or (iii) Lender reasonably believes that I abandoned the Property, then  Lender may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender's interest in the Property and/   or Lender's rights under this Security Instrument, including protecting and/or assessing the value of the Property,   and securing and/or repairing the Property. Lender's actions may include, but are not limited to: (I) paying any Sums  Secured by a lien that has priority or may attain priority over this Security Instrument; (II) appearing in court, and (TIT)  paying: (A) reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, (B) property inspection and valuation fees; and (C) other fees incurred  for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including its  secured position in a bankruptcy proceeding. Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, exterior and interior  inspections of the Property, entering the Property to make repairs, hanging locks, replacing or boarding up doors and  windows, draining water from pipes, eliminating building or other code violations or dangerous conditions, and having  utilities tumed on or off. Although Lender may take action under this Section 9, Lender is not required to do so and 1s  not under any duty or obligation to do so unless required by Applicable Law. I agree that Lender will not be hable for  not taking any or all actions authorized under this Section 9.    (b) Avoiding Foreclosure; Mitigating Losses. If] am in Default, Lender may work with me to avoid foreclosure  and/or mitigate Lender's potential losses, but is not obligated to do so unless required by Applicable Law. Lender may  take reasonable actions to evaluate me for available alternatives to foreclosure, including, but not limited to, obtaining  credit reports, title reports, title insurance, property valuations, subordination agreements, and third-party approvals. I  authorize and consent to these actions, Any costs associated with such loss mitigation activities may be paid by Lender  and recovered from me as described below in Section 9(c), unless prohibited by Applicable Law.

    (c) Additional Amounts Secured. I will pay to Lender any amounts, with interest, which Lender spends under this  Section 9. I will pay those amounts to Lender when Lender sends me a notice requesting that I do so. I will pay interest  on those amounts at the interest rate set forth in the Note. Interest on each amount will begin on the date that the  amount is spent by Lender. These amounts will become my additional debt that is secured by this Security Instrument.    (d) Leasehold Terms. If [ do not own but am a tenant on the Property, I will fulfill all my obligations under my lease. |  also agree that, if] subsequently purchase or otherwise become the owner of the Property, my interest as the tenant and  my interest as the owner will remain separate unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing.    10. Assignment of Rents.    (a) Assignment of Rents. If the Property is leased to, used by, or occupied by a third party (‘“Tenant’’), I  unconditionally assign and transfer to Lender any Rents, regardless of to whom the Rents are payable. | authorize  Lender to collect the Rents, and agree that each Tenant will pay the Rents to Lender. However, I will receive the Rents  until (i) Lender has given me notice of Default pursuant to Section 26, and (1i) Lender has given notice to the Tenant  that the Rents are to be paid to Lender. This Section 10 constitutes an-absolute assignment and not an assignment for  additional security only.    (b) Notice of Default. If Lender gives me notice of Default: (i) I will hold all Rents I recetve as trustee for the benefit  of Lender only, to be applied to the Sums Secured; (ii) Lender will be entitled to collect and receive all of the Rents;  (iii) I agree to instruct each Tenant that Tenant is to pay all Rents due and, unpaid to Lender upon Lender's written  demand to the Tenant; (iv) I will ensure that each Tenant pays all Rents due to Lender and will take whatever action is  necessary to collect such Rents if not paid to Lender; (v) unless Applicable Law provides otherwise, all Rents collected  by Lender will be applied first to the costs of taking control of and managing the Property and collecting the Rents,  including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, receiver's fees, premiums on receiver's bonds, repair  and maintenance costs, insurance premiums, taxes, assessments, and other charges on the Property, and then to any  other Sums Secured: (vi) Lender, or any judicially appointed receiver, will be liable to account for only those Rents  actually received; and (vii) Lender will be entitled to have a receiver appointed to take possession of and manage the  Property and collect the Rents and profits derived from the Property without any showing as to the inadequacy of the  Property as security.    (c) Funds Paid by Lender. If the Rents are not sufficient to cover the costs of taking control of and managing the  Property and of collecting the Rents, any funds paid by Lender for such purposes will become Sums Secured pursuant  to Section 9.    (d) Limitation on Collection of Rents. I may not collect any of the Rents more than one month in advance of the time  when the Rents become due, except for security or similar deposits.    (e) No Other Assignment of Rents. I represent, warrant, covenant, and agree that I have not signed any prior  assignment of the Rents, will not make any further assignment of the Rents, and have not performed, and will not  perform, any act that could prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this Security Instrument.    (f) Control and Maintenance of the Property. Unless required by Applicable Law, Lender, or a receiver appointed  under Applicable Law, is not obligated to enter upon, take control of, or maintain the Property before or after giving  notice of Default to me. However, Lender, or a receiver appointed under Applicable Law, may do so at any time when I  am in Default, subject to Applicable Law.    (2) Additional Provisions. Any application of the Rents will not cure or waive any Default or invalidate any other  right or remedy of Lender. This Section 10 does not relieve me of my obligations under Section 6.    This Section 10 will terminate when all the Sums Secured are paid in full.    11. Mortgage Insurance.    (a) Payment of Premiums; Substitution of Policy; Loss Reserve; Protection of Lendor. If Lender required  Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan, I will pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage  Insurance in effect. If 1 was required to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage  Insurance, and (i) the Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases for any reason to be available from the  mortgage insurer that previously provided such insurance, or (ii) Lender determines in its sole discretion that such         DOSS876200  NEW YORK-Single Family-Fannia Maa/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT (MERS)} Form 3033 o7/2021  VWwollers Kluwer Financlal Services, Ine.

    mortgage insurer is no longer eligible to provide the Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender, 1 will pay the  premiums required to obtain coverage substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, at a cost  substantially equivalent to the cost to me of the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, from an alternate mortgage  insurer selected by Lender.    If substantially equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is not available and if I was required to make separately  designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Lender will establish a loss reserve as a substitute  for the Mortgage Insurance coverage. Lender will retain these payments, and will use these payments to pay for losses  that the Mortgage Insurance would have covered. Such loss reserve will not be refundable. Lender will not be required  to pay me any interest or earnings on such loss reserve.    Lender will no longer require loss reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance coverage again becomes available and is  obtained. In that case, I will once again pay Mortgage Insurance premiums. The Mortgage Insurance coverage must be  in the amount and for the period of time required by Lender. The insurance company providing the coverage is subject  to Lender approval.    I will pay the Mortgage Insurance premiums, or the non-refundable loss reserve payments, until the requirement   for Mortgage Insurance ends according to any written agreement between Lender and me that provides for such  termination or until termination of Mortgage Insurance is required by Applicable Law. Lender may require me to pay  the premiums, or the loss reserve payments, in the manner described in this Section 11.    This Section 11, and the existence or termination of my obligation to pay Mortgage Insurance premiums or reserve  payments, does not affect my obligation to pay interest under the Note at the rate set by the Note.    (b) Mortgage Insurance Agreements. Mortgage Insurance policy reimburses Lender for certain losses Lender may  incur if I do not repay the Loan as agreed. J am not a party to the Mortgage Insurance policy or coverage.    Mortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all Mortgage Insurance from time to time, and may enter into agreements  with other parties to share or modify their risk, or reduce losses. These agreements may require the mortgage insurer  to make payments using any source of funds that the mortgage insurer may have available (which may include funds  obtained from Mortgage Insurance premiums).    As a result of these agreements, Lender, another insurer, any reinsurer, any other entity, or any affiliate of any of the  foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts that come from (or might be characterized as) a portion of my  payments for Mortgage Insurance, in exchange for sharing or changing the mortgage insurer’s risk, or reducing losses.    Any such agreements will not: (i) affect the amounts that I have apreed to pay for Mortgage Insurance, or any other  terms of the Loan; (ii) increase the amount I will owe for Mortgage Insurance; (iii) entitle me to any refund; or (iv)  affect the rights [ have, if any, with respect to the Mortgage Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998  (12 U.S.C. § 4901 et seq.), as it may be amended from time to time, or any additional or successor federal legislation  or regulation that governs the same subject matter (“HP4”), These rights under the HPA may include the mght to  receive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation of the Mortgage Insurance, have the Mortgage Insurance  terminated automatically, and/or receive a refund of any Mortgage Insurance premiums that were not earned at the time  of such cancellation or termination.    12. Assignment and Application of Miscellaneous Proceeds and Condemnation of the Property;  Forfeiture.    (a) Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds. I unconditionally assign the right to receive all Miscellaneous Proceeds  to Lender and agree that such amounts will be paid to Lender,    (b) Application of Miscellaneous Proceeds upon Damage to Property. If the Property is damaged, any  Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if Lender deems the restoration or    repair to be economically feasible and Lender's security will not be lessened by such restoration or repair. During such  repair and restoration period, Lender will have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds until Lender bas had    an opportunity to inspect the Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction (which may  include satisfying Lender's minimum eligibility requirements for Persons repairing the Property, including, but not  limited to, licensing, bond, and insurance requirements) provided that such inspection must be undertaken promptly.  Lender may pay for the repairs and restoration in a single disbursement or in a series of progress payments as the work         Oo0aSs7e200  NEW YORK-Singla Famlh-Fannie Mee Freddia Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT (MERS) Form 3033 OF 2021  Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, ine. oerada4    2025009125.1 0.611 20 2267 Page 10 of 18

    is completed, depending on the size of the repair or restoration, the terms of the repair agreement, and whether I am   in Default on the Loan, Lender may make such disbursements directly to me, to the Person repairing or restoring the  Property, or payable jointly to both. Unless Lender and I agree in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid  on the Miscellaneous Proceeds, Lender will not be required to pay me any interest or earnings on such Miscellaneous  Proceeds. If Lender deems the restoration or repair not to be economically feasible or Lender's security would be  lessened by such restoration or repair, the Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied to the Sums Secured, whether or   not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to me. Such Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied in the order that Partial  Payments are applied in Section 2(b).    (c) Application of Miscellaneous Proceeds upon Condemnation, Destruction, or Loss in Value of the Property. In  the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property, all of the Miscellaneous Proceeds will be used  to reduce the Sums Secured, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to me,    In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property (each, a “Partial Devaluation”) where the  fair market value of the Property immediately before the Partial Devaluation is equal to or greater than the amount   of the Sums Secured immediately before the Partial Devaluation, a percentage of the Miscellaneous Proceeds will be  applied to the Sums Secured unless the Lender and I otherwise agree in writing. The amount of the Miscellaneous  Proceeds that will be so applied is determined by multiplying the total amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds by a  percentage calculated by taking (i) the total amount of the Sums Secured immediately before the Partial Devaluation,  and dividing it by (ii) the fair market value of the Property immediately before the Partial Devaluation. Any balance of  the Miscellaneous Proceeds will be paid to me.    In the event of a Partial Devaluation where the fair market value of the Property immediately before the Partial  Devaluation is less than the amount of the Sums Secured immediately before the Partial Devaluation, all of the  Miscellaneous Proceeds will be used to reduce the Sums Secured, whether or not the sums are then due, unless the  Lender and I otherwise agree in writing.    (d) Settlement of Claims. Lender is authorized to collect and apply the Miscellaneous Proceeds either to the Sums  Secured, whether or not then due, or to restoration or repair of the Property, if I (i) abandon the Property, or (ii) fail   to respond to Lender within 30 days after the date Lender notifies me that the Opposing Party (as defined im the next  sentence) offers to settle a claim for damages. “Opposing Party” means the third party that owes me the Miscellaneous  Proceeds or the party against whom I have a legal right of action in regard to the Miscellaneous Proceeds.    (e) Proceeding Affecting Lender's Interest in the Property. I will be in Default if any lawsuit or other legal  proceeding begins seeking Forfeiture of the Property or seeking any other significant reduction of Lender's interest in  the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. “Forfeiture” means a legal order or judgment that takes away  some or all of my rights in the Property, whether in a civil or in a criminal proceeding. I can cure such a Default and,  if acceleration (as described in Section 26(a) below) has occurred, reinstate as provided in Section 20, by causing   the lawsuit or legal proceeding to be dismissed with a legal ruling that, in Lender's reasonable judgment, precludes  Forfeiture or any significant reduction of Lender's interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. ©  I will unconditionally assign to Lender the proceeds of any award or claim for damages that are attributable to a  reduction of Lender's interest in the Property, which proceeds will be paid to Lender.    All Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property will be applied in the order that  Partial Payments are applied in Section 2(b).    43. Continuation of Borrower’s Obligations and of Lender’s Rights.    (a) Borrower's Obligations. Lender may allow me and any Successor in Interest of Borrower to delay or to change  the amount of the Periodic Payments of principal and interest due under the Note or under this Security Instrument.  Even if Lender does this, however, I and any Successor in Interest of Borrower will both still be fully obligated under  the Note and under this Security Instrument.    Lender may allow those delays or changes for a Successor in Interest of Borrower even If Lender is requested not   to do so. Lender will not be required to bring a lawsuit against a Successor in Interest of Borrower for not fulfilling  obligations under the Note or under this Security Instrument, even if Lender is requested to do so by me or a Successor  in Interest of Borrower. Lender may or may not take such actions in its sole discretion.    I  OOasearesoo   NEW YORK-Single Family-Fannie MaeiFreddie Mac UNIFORM [NSTRUMENT (MERS) : Form 2083 OF 202  Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc. Chala 4.

    (b) Lender's Rights. Even if Lender does not exercise or enforce any right of Lender under this Secunty Instrument  or under Applicable Law, Lender will still have all of those rights and may exercise and enforce them in the future.  Even if: (i) Lender obtains insurance, pays taxes, or pays other claims, charges, or liens against the Property; (11)  Lender accepts payments from third Persons or Successors in Interest of Borrower; or (iii) Lender accepts payments  in amounts less than the amount then due, Lender will have the right under Section 26 below to demand that I make  immediate payment in full of any amounts remaining due and payable to Lender under the Note and under this  Security Instrument.    14, Obligations of Borrower and of Persons Taking over Borrower's Rights or Obligations. If more  than one Person signs this Security Instrument as Borrower, each of us is fully obligated to keep all of Borrower's  promises and obligations contained in this Security Instrument. Lender may enforce Lender’s rights under this Security  Instrument against each of us individually or against all of us together. This means that any one of us may be required  to pay all of the Sums Secured, However, if one of us does not sign the Note, that Person: (a) signs this Security  Instrument only to give that Person’s rights in the Property to Lender under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b)  signs this Security Instrument to waive any applicable inchoate rights such as dower and curtesy and any available  homestead exemptions; (c) signs this Security Instrument to assign any Miscellaneous Proceeds, Rents, or other  earnings from the Property to Lender; (d) is not personally obligated to pay the Sums Secured; and (e) agrees that  Lender can agree with the other Borrowers to delay enforcing any of Lender's rights or to extend, modify, or make any  accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the Note without that Person’s consent and  without affecting that Person’s obligations under this Security Instrument.    Subject to the provisions of Section 19, any Person who takes over my tights or obligations under this Security  Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender in writing, will have all of my rights and will be obligated to keep  all of my promises and agreements made in this Security Instrument. I will not be released from my obligations and  liabilities under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in writing.    15. Loan Charges.    (a) Tax and Flood Determination Fees. Unless prohibited by Applicable Law, Lender may require me to pay (4) a  one-time charge for an independent real estate tax verification and/or reporting service used by Lender in connection  with this Loan, and (ii) either (A) a one-time charge for flood zone determination, certification, and tracking services,  or (B) a one-time charge for flood zone determination and certification services and subsequent charges each time  remappings or similar changes occur that reasonably might affect such determination or certification. I will also be  responsible for the payment of any fees imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or any successor  agency, at any time during the Loan term, in connection with any flood zone determinations.    (b) Default Charges. If permitted under Applicable Law, Lender may charge me fees for services performed in  connection with my Default to protect Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument,  including: (i) reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs; (ii) property inspection, valuation, mediation, and loss mitigation  fees; and (iii) other related fees.    (c) Permissibility of Fees. In regard to any other fees, the fact that this Security Instrument does not expressly indicate  that Lender may charge me a certain fee does not mean that Lender cannot charge that fee. Lender may not charge fees  that are expressly prohibited by this Security Instrument or by Applicable Law.    (d) Savings Clause. If Applicable Law sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so that the  interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the permitted limits,   then (i) any such loan charge will be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit, and  (ii) any sums already collected from me which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me. Lender may choose  to make this refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to me. If a refund  reduces principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any prepayment charge (whether or not    a prepayment charge is provided for under the Note). To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, my acceptance of any  such refund made by direct payment to me will constitute a waiver of any right of action | might have arising out of    such overcharge.    16. Notices Required under this Security Instrument; Borrower's Physical Address. All notices given by  me or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument must be in writing.

    (a) Notices to Borrower. Unless Applicable Law requires a different method, any written notice to me in connection  with this Security Instrument will be deemed to have been given to me when (i) mailed by first class mail, or (11)  actually delivered to my Notice Address (as defined in Section 16(c) below) if sent by means other than first class mail  or Electronic Communication (as defined in Section 16(b) below). Notice to any one Borrower will constitute notice   to all Borrowers unless Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise. If any notice to me required by this Security  Instrument is also required under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy the corresponding  requirement under this Security Instrument.    (b) Electronic Notice to Borrower. Unless another delivery method is required by Applicable Law, Lender may  provide me with notice by e-mail or other electronic communication (“Electronic Communication ”’) if: (1) agreed   to by Lender and me in writing; (ii) I have provided Lender with my e-mail or other electronic address (“Electronic  Address’); (iii) Lender provides me with the option to receive notices by first class mail or by other non-Electronic  Communication instead of by Electronic Communication; and (iv) Lender otherwise complies with Applicable Law.  Any notice to me sent by Electronic Communication in connection with this Security Instrument will be deemed to  have been given to me when sent unless Lender becomes aware that such notice is not delivered. If Lender becomes  aware that any notice sent by Electronic Communication 1s not delivered, Lender will resend such communication to  me by first class mail or by other non-Electronic Communication. I may withdraw my agreement to receive Electronic  Communications from Lender at any time by providing written notice to Lender of my withdrawal of such agreement.    (c) Borrower's Notice Address. The address to which Lender will send me notice (“Notice Address”) will be the  Property Address unless I have designated a different address by written notice to Lender. If Lender and I have agreed  that notice may be given by Electronic Communication, then | may designate an Electronic Address as Notice Address.  I will promptly notify Lender of my change of Notice Address, including any changes to my Electronic Address if  designated as Notice Address. If Lender specifies a procedure for reporting my change of Notice Address, then I will  report a change of Notice Address only through that specified procedure.    (d) Notices to Lender. Any notice to Lender will be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to  Lender's address stated in this Security Instrument unless Lender has designated another address (including an  Electronic Address) by notice to me. Any notice in connection with this Security Instrument will be deemed to have  been given to Lender only when actually received by Lender at Lender's designated address (which may include an  Electronic Address). If any notice to Lender required by this Security Instrument is also required under Applicable  Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security Instrument.    (e) Borrower's Physical Address. In addition to the designated Notice Address, | agree to provide Lender with the  address where I physically reside, if different from the Property Address, and notify Lender whenever this address    changes.    47. Law That Governs this Security Instrument; Word Usage. This Security Instrument is governed by  federal law and the law of the State of New York. All rights and obligations contained in this Security Instrument are  subject to any requirements and limitations of Applicable Law. If any term of this Security Instrument or the Note  conflicts with Applicable Law (i) such conflict will not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note  that can be given effect without the conflicting provision, and (ii) such conflicting provision, to the extent possible,  will be considered modified to comply with Applicable Law. Applicable Law might explicitly or implicitly allow   the parties to agree by contract or it might be silent, but such silence should not be construed as a prohibition against  agreement by contract. This means that the Security Instrument or the Note will remain as if the conflicting provision  did not exist. Any action required under this Security Instrument to be made in accordance with Applicable Law is to  be made in accordance with the Applicable Law in effect at the time the action is undertaken.    As used in this Security Instrument: (a) words in the singular will mean and include the plural and vice versa; (b)  the word "may" gives sole discretion without any obligation to take any action; (c) any reference to “Section” in  this document refers to Sections contained in this Security Instrument unless otherwise noted; and (d) the headings  and captions are inserted for cenyenience of reference and do not define, limit, or describe the scope or intent of this    Security Instrument or any particular Section, paragraph, or provision.  48.

    19. Agreements about Lender’s Rights If the Property Is Sold or Transferred. For purposes of this Section  19 only, “Interest in the Property” means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited   to, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment sales contract, or escrow  agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by me toa purchaser at a future date.    Lender may require immediate payment in full of all Sums Secured if all or any part of the Property, or if any Interest  in the Property, is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not a natural Person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is  sold or transferred) without Lender’s prior written consent. However, Lender will not exercise this option 1f such  exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.    If Lender requires immediate payment in full under this Section 19, Lender will give me a notice in accordance with  Section 16. The notice will give me at least 30 days to make the required payment. The 30-day period will begin on  the date the notice is mailed or delivered. If I do not make the required payment during that period, Lender may act   to enforce its rights under this Security Instrument without giving me any further notice or demand for payment and  will be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing such remedies, including, but not limited to: (a) reasonable  attorneys’ fees and costs; (b) property inspection and valuation fees; and (c) other fees incurred to protect Lender's  Interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument.    20. Borrower's Right to Reinstate the Loan. Even if Lender has required immediate payment in full, I may  have the right to reinstate the Loan and to have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued. I will have this  right at any time up to the later of (a) five days before any foreclosure sale of the Property, or (b) such other period as  Applicable Law might specify for the termination of my right to reinstate. This right to reimstate will not apply in the  case of acceleration under Section 19.    To reinstate the Loan, 1 must satisfy all of the following conditions: (aa) I pay to Lender the full amount that then  would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note as if immediate payment in full had never been required;  (bb) I correct my failure to keep any of my other promises or agreements made in this Security Instrument or the  Note; (cc) I pay all of Lender’s reasonable expenses in enforcing this Security Instrument or the Note, including,   but not limited to: (i) reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs; (ii) property inspection and valuation fees; and (11) other  fees incurred to protect Lender’s interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument or the Note; and  (dd) 1 do whatever Lender reasonably requires to assure that Lender’s interest in the Property, Lender’s nghts under  this Security Instrument or the Note, and my obligations under this Security Instrument or under the Note continue  unchanged.    Lender may require that I pay such reinstatement sums and expenses in one or more of the following forms, as  selected by Lender: (aaa) cash; (bbb) money order; (ccc) certified check, bank check, treasurer’s check, or cashier's  check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a U.S. federal agency,  instrumentality, or entity; or (ddd) Electronic Fund Transfer, Upon my reinstatement of the Loan, this Security  Instrument and obligations secured by this Security Instrument will remain fully effective as if no acceleration had  occurred.    21. Note Holder's Right to Sell the Note or an Interest in the Note. The Note or a partial interest in the Note,  together with this Security Instrument, may be sald or otherwise transferred one or more times. Upon such a sale or  other transfer, all of Lender’s rights and obligations under this Security Instrument will transfer to Lender’s successors    and assigns.    22. Loan Servicer. Lender may take any action permitted under this Security Instrument through the Loan Servicer  or another authorized representative, such as a sub-servicer. I understand that the Loan Servicer or other authorized    representative of Lender has the right and authority to take any such action.    The Loan Servicer may change one or more times during the term of the Note. The Loan Servicer may or may not   he the holder of the Note. The Loan Servicer has the right and authority to: (a) collect my Periodic Payments and   any other amounts due under the Note and this Security Instrument; (b) perform any other mortgage loan servicing  obligations; and (c) exercise any rights under the Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law on behalf of  Lender.

    23. Notice of Grievance. Until Lender or I have notified the other party (in accordance with Section 16) of an  alleged breach and afforded the other party a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action,  neither Lender nor I may start a lawsuit or legal proceeding or join, or be joined to, an existing lawsuit (such as a class  action) that (a) arises from the other party’s actions pursuant to this Security Instrument or the Note or that claims the  other party broke any promise or failed to fulfill any duty under this Security Instrument, or (b) alleges that the other  party has not fulfilled any of its obligations under this Security Instrument or the Note. If Applicable Law provides a  time period that must elapse before certain action can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable for  purposes of this Section 23. ‘The notice of Default given to me under Section 19 will be deemed to satisfy the notice  and opportunity to take corrective action provisions of this Section 23.
