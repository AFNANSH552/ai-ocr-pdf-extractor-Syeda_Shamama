If Applicable Law sets maximurn loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so that the  interest or other loan charges collected or to be col in connection with the Loan exceed the permitted limits, then  (i) any such loan charge will be reduced by the amount nécessary to reduce the charge to the permitted Imit, and (ii} any  sums already collacted from me which exceaded penmitted limits will be refunded to me. Londer may choose to make this  refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to me.
